# MTH 452 Data Science Final Project

Project from Fall 2021, just decided to put it on github.

The [used car prices project](used-car-prices.ipynb) was a lot more thorough than the [credit card fraud project](credit-card-fraud.ipynb). Both levereged some basic machine learning algorithms and needed a fair amount of cleaning before any real work could be done.
